#Scala Lorenz Attractor

A simple differential equation integrator that uses Euler's method to solve a system of differential equations.

The system that is programmed here is the [Lorenz Attractor](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/LorenzAttractor.html).

It's a functional implementation, as I'm learning functional programming.

I hope to add to this project and maybe branch off and build up a solid library of scala numerical functions.
